/**

 *
 * This file defines macros to allow writing CABSL state machines in skill implementations.
 * The largest difference to regular CABSL is that action_done and action_aborted are missing.
 * isDone and isAborted of the called skills should be used directly instead (although there is
 * a slight difference in the semantics if skills are called more than once per frame).
 * This file cannot be included when Cabsl.h is already included.
