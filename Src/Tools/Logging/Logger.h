/**

 *
 * This file declares a class that writes a subset of representations into
 * log files. The representations can stem from multiple parallel threads.
 * The class maintains a buffer of message queues that can be claimed by
 * individual threads, filled with data, and given back to the logger for
 * writing them to the log file.
